### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to apply css flex-box to real css components. I refreshed my memory on basic css concepts like the box model. I also how to use variable units instead of static units to style things like padding, margin, and even font sizes.

Most importantly I learned the basics of how to use the BEM (Block, element, modifier) naming convention in CSS. It makes your CSS more modular and readable, and you know the exact purpose of each selector.

### Continued development

I want to continue using the BEM naming convention from now on, even in smaller projects because of how readable it makes your CSS.

### Useful resources

-   [Simple web dev article on BEM](https://simple-web.dev/bem-by-example) - This is also a great resource with more real world examples of how BEM is used.
